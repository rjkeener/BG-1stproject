[descriptions]
charset=The character set needed for the language (standard code for an ASCII character set). Most people leave this as 'utf-8' (Unicode, works with any characters), although regional character sets are supported also. ISO charsets should be upper case. UTF character sets should be lower case (e.g. utf-8).
dir=The direction. Western/most languages are 'ltr' (left-to-right), while languages such as Arabic are 'rtl' (right-to-left). It should only ever hold a value of 'ltr' or 'rtl', i.e. should never be translated directly. An "rtl" language would likely require many few template changes as well as language changes. If someone does this we would consider integrating the changes back into a future version of Composr.
en_left=Sometimes templates have to apply CSS properties values of 'left' or 'right', according to the text direction. Switch this to 'right' for rtl languages. It should only ever hold a value of 'left' or 'right', i.e. should never be translated directly.
en_right=Sometimes templates have to apply CSS properties values of 'left' or 'right', according to the text direction. Switch this to 'left' for rtl languages. It should only ever hold a value of 'left' or 'right', i.e. should never be translated directly.
dictionary=The name of the pspell/hunspell dictionary to use.
dictionary_variant=The variant of the pspell/hunspell dictionary. If you're not sure just set it the same as 'dictionary' (i.e. the main dictionary name).
takes_lots_of_space=Set this to 1 if the language tends to stretch out further horizontally; at the time of writing this is used to reduce menu font size so that stuff fits, otherwise 0.
date_withinweek_date=A day of the week. Used for contextual dates. See http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for guidance.
date_withinweek_joiner=The divider between date_withinweek_date and date_regular_time.
date_concise_near_date=A date (very short, probably no year component), see http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for guidance.
date_regular_date=A date (short), see http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for guidance.
date_no_year=A date with no year, see http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for guidance.
date_regular_joiner=The divider between date_regular_date and date_regular_time.
date_regular_time=A time (short), see http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for guidance. Note that if you're running an international site, you might want to put your timezone on here and related time strings.
date_verbose_date=A date (long), see http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for guidance.
date_verbose_joiner=The divider between date_verbose_date and date_verbose_time.
date_verbose_time=A time (long), see http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php for guidance.
locale=A comma-separated list of locale codes, given in priority (different systems have different availability, and convention). There are standard locale codes for unix, based on language codes, but they vary across operating system: use what works on your server. The locale code is used to prepare certain operating system date strings, and number formatting. On Linux and MacOS you can find the list of locales via the 'locale -a' command. You can separate multiple locales with commas; the first valid one will be used.
locale_subst=A comma-separated list of string substitutions to perform on date and time output, designed for environments where the locale does not perform adequately out-of-the-box. An appropriate example string would be: 'January=Januare,February=Februare,Wednesday=Wedway'. Usually you'll leave this as '(empty)', but it is good for fixing problems with unreliable locale.
dont_escape_trick=Ignore this string, it is purely used by code, and should never have its value be changed.
POST_DATA=This does not refer to 'a post'. It's a POSTed HTTP form.
MULTIPLE=More than one, many.
NA=Not Applicable.
USE=Not the verb, 'to use', but 'the use' of something.
SKIP_NAVIGATION=This is for accessibility reasons &ndash; it is used as the text of a link which exists past the top of the site to allow tab skipping.
CONTENTS=This is contents as in what you get at the start of a book.
CONCEDED_MODE=Conceded mode is like a partial log-out, where you are declaring that to get back into the Admin Zone you should have to enter your username and password again (basically).
CURRENTLY_HAS_KEEP_FATALISTIC=Fatalistic mode is a mode whereby all errors are treated like fatal errors, with a stack trace. It is useful for developers and power-users as a way to trace the source of error messages in the Composr code.
POLLS=Polls, i.e. multiple polls
POLL=Poll, i.e. a single poll
NAME=Name, noun
DOWNLOAD=Download, verb

CHILD_PAGES=Child is metaphorical, we're talking about hierarchical structure
NO_CHILDREN=Child is metaphorical, we're talking about hierarchical structure
SORT_BY=Designed to be followed directly by what is to be sorted by (it may be a drop-down list, or a label). As opposed to the 'SORT' string which is just a verb and typically used as a button.
WITH_SIMPLE=Designed to be used with a username as a parameter, i.e. with a person
WITH_SIMPLE_LOWER=Designed to be used with a username as a parameter, i.e. with a person
ROOT=The root category in a metaphorical tree structure
LIST_SEP=For separating list items
