SSL_CONFIGURATION=SSL/TLS (HTTPS) configuration
SSL_PAGE_SELECT=Select which pages you would like to use the HTTPS <abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr>/<abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> protocol. An HTTPS page view encrypts bi-directional traffic securely (to avoid unauthorised tampering and interception by third-parties) but also imposes a performance cost on the server. To use HTTPS you must have an SSL/TLS certificate installed on your server, and have the website files accessible via both HTTPS and HTTP variants of the base-URL.
DOC_SSL=If you have a dedicated server which is configured with an SSL/TLS certificate, tied into your domain, and if the server is configured to use the same file system for HTTPS as for HTTP, then you may choose to make certain pages work via HTTPS.
