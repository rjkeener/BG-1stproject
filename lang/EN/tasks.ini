TASKS_BACKGROUND=Use a task queue
CONFIG_OPTION_tasks_background=Tasks that might take some time to complete may cause dangerous spikes in server resource consumption, or may time out on hosting that limits execution time. Enabling this option will put long running tasks into a queue, and the results will be sent in a notification once the task is processed. A queue reduces the user experience, but protects your performance or keeps you within limits &ndash; therefore enable it if you have a busy site, a lot of data, or are on locked-down hosting.
