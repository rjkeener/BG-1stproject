MEMBER_BANNED=Whether a member is banned

[strings]
DOC_IP_BAN=Banning IP addresses is useful to totally remove a user's ability to access the site; unfortunately, users can very easily switch IP addresses so it is not a perfect tool.
BANNED_ADDRESSES=Banned IP addresses
EXTERNALLY_BANNED_ADDRESSES=Externally banned addresses (will timeout according to your &ldquo;Block list cache time&rdquo; setting)
DESCRIPTION_BANNED_ADDRESSES_A=You may ban IP addresses from accessing this website using this tool.
DESCRIPTION_BANNED_ADDRESSES_B=Each line of the text box below indicates an IP address that is banned. Wildcards may be used. You may enter a note to the right of each address if you wish.
SPAM_AUTO_BAN_TIMEOUT={1} {2} - until {3}
IP_BANNING_WILDCARDS=IP address bans restrict access to the website on a low level. Be careful to [url="know an IP address"]{1}[/url] before you ban it to avoid inadvertently banning a shared computer/Internet-gateway. Please also be advised that [abbr="Internet Service Provider"]ISP[/abbr]-assigned addresses are often not fixed: a computer's IP address might vary substantially from one day to the next.\n\nAddresses may contain &lsquo;wildcards&rsquo; (asterisks) between dotted segments to symbolise that any number in that segment will match.\n\nIt is usual to have an asterisk as the final (fourth) part, as a user's IP address is very likely to change in that final component and at the same time it is very unlikely that wildcarding that last portion would result in any unintended bans. This said, extreme care is advised using wildcards at other points.
