AUTO_BAN_HACK_MESSAGE=An IP address, {1}, has been automatically banned for generating {2} hackattack alerts. If you believe these were false alarms, or that the user was manipulated into triggering the alerts, you may wish to unban this IP address. A summary of the alerts follows:\n{3}\n\nManage IP bans from this screen:\n[url="{4}"]{4}[/url]
AUTO_BAN_DOS_MESSAGE=An IP address, {1}, has been automatically banned for generating {2} flood warnings in {3} seconds. If you believe that the user was manipulated into triggering the alerts, you may wish to consider unbanning this IP address. Be advised that the website software has essentially prevented what could be a 'DOS' (Denial Of Service) attack which could over-load the server if left to continue; it may have been triggered by innocent infected computers, or other form of computer manipulation. This said, this may just be an innocent computer that accidentally or for good reason, using up a high server load.
NO_SUCH_THEME=No such theme, <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
NO_THEME_PERMISSION=No permission to access theme, <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
NO_SUCH_THEME_IMAGE=No such theme image, <kbd>{1}</kbd>.

NETWORK_DOWN=The network or website appears to be down, so an AJAX request has failed. You won't receive further warnings during this page view, but some actions may not work correctly until connectivity is restored.
HACK_ATTACK_INFO=A potential hacking attempt has been detected. Please do not be alarmed: approximately half of the suspected attempts are triggered innocently (the software intentionally has a paranoid security model, to give you very high security). Real hacking attempts are almost always caused by 'bots' (computer programs) that automatically crawl the Internet looking for websites which may contain vulnerabilities, and then reporting any found vulnerabilities to their 'master' for future exploitation (usually, to assist in spam relaying). If this was a real hack attempt, it has failed - you might want to try and analyse the logged details (in case it gives clues to a real and persistent offender). More information on security is given in the software documentation.
ERROR_MAIL=An error occurred at:\n[url="{1}"]{1}[/url]\nHappened to IP address: {3}.\n\nThe full error details follow:\n\n[html]{2}[/html]
REFERRER=(Referrer is: {1}, User agent is: {2})
LANGUAGE_CORRUPTION=Language corruption detected and fixed (when looking up language string #{1}). This means that a database inconsistency had developed, but has fixed itself.
SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN_POSTED=You have gone to an URL which requires &lsquo;posted&rsquo; data to be sent (<kbd>{1}</kbd>), as well as the information in the URL itself. This is most likely because you have copied and pasted a link to a new browser window, but the page the link was for was a results page for an action.
SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN_POSTED_FILE_ERROR=It appears that you have made a file upload but exceeded this servers &lsquo;post_max_size&rsquo; limit ({2}) or &lsquo;upload_max_filesize&rsquo; limit ({3}). Unfortunately this makes your form submission invisible to the software. Please try again with a smaller size, or get the <kbd>post_max_size</kbd> limit increased. An alternate explanation is if you reached this URL manually &ndash; this URL is intended solely for processing the result of a form submitted to it, and the <var>{1}</var> parameter is missing.
WRITE_ERROR=Cannot write to <kbd>{1}</kbd>. File permissions for it (or the directory it is in) have not been set correctly.
READ_ERROR=Cannot read the <kbd>{1}</kbd> file. It is probably missing.
WRITE_ERROR_DIRECTORY_REPAIR=Cannot create a directory <kbd>{1}</kbd>. This file should have existed anyway, but we tried to repair it and failed. Please create this directory manually and apply full write permissions.
WRITE_ERROR_DIRECTORY=Cannot create a directory <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Please apply full write permissions to the parent directory (<kbd>{2}</kbd>).
WRITE_ERROR_MISSING_DIRECTORY=An expected directory, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, is missing.
WRITE_ERROR_CREATE=Cannot create a <kbd>{1}</kbd> file. File permissions for the <kbd>{2}</kbd> directory have not been set correctly.
ERROR_UPLOADING=Error detected with respect to the upload of a file: unknown error.
ERROR_UPLOADING_1=Error detected with respect to the upload of a file: the uploaded file is too large (case 1).

ERROR_UPLOADING_3=Error detected with respect to the upload of a file: the uploaded file was only partially uploaded.
ERROR_UPLOADING_4=Error detected with respect to the upload of a file: no file was selected, or a missing file was chosen.
ERROR_UPLOADING_6=Error detected with respect to the upload of a file: the server is missing a temporary folder for the file.

COMCODE_ERROR=There is an error ({1}) in your Comcode at line {2}.
COMCODE_ERROR_TITLE=Comcode error
COMCODE_REPLACEMENT=Enter your corrected Comcode here.
UNKNOWN_DIRECTIVE=Unknown tempcode directive, <kbd>{1}</kbd>
TEMPCODE_TOO_MANY_CLOSES=Brace/directive mismatch: too many closes, or closed one that was not open in <kbd>{1}</kbd> on line {2}
NO_DIRECTIVE_TYPE=No directive type specified in <kbd>{1}</kbd> on line {2}
ABRUPTED_DIRECTIVE_OR_BRACE=Abrupted brace or directive in template <kbd>{1}</kbd> on line {2}
UNCLOSED_DIRECTIVE_OR_BRACE=Non-closed brace or directive in template <kbd>{1}</kbd> on line {2}
COMPLEX_FIRST_PARAMETER=You aren't allowed to build up variable names dynamically via nesting, they should be alphanumeric strings with optional trailing escaping characters.
ATTACHMENT_WOULD_NOT_UPLOAD=The attachment would not upload. Perhaps there was a connection problem, or the file was larger than the allowed attachment size ({1} MB for files, {2} MB for images).
STACK_TRACE_INFORMATION=Below is a stack trace revealing the state the software was in when the error occurred. If this represents a bug in the unmodified software, you may want to check {1} website for a fix, and if there isn't one, report this as a bug. Please note that merely posting a stack trace is not sufficient for us to solve your problem; the stack trace is just an aid that presents us with additional information. We still need to know the error message, what you tried to do, how you tried to do it, version numbers, and any other appropriate information.<br />We apologise for this problem and if it's a bug we hope you will work with us so that we can fix it for you promptly.

NO_PARAMETER_SENT=A critical parameter, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was missing.
NO_PARAMETER_SENT_SPECIAL=A critical parameter, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was missing. This error usually happens when the website engine has been installed with an incorrect base-URL (such as http://example.com/ instead of http://www.example.com/). Some server configurations allow multiple domain names as illustrated, but perform automated redirections which result in parameter loss. If you are the site owner you may need to reconfigure your server or base-URL.

If you do not have JavaScript in your browser because you have a disability, you should be able to still achieve what you need through other site features: if this is not the case, please contact the site staff.
MERGE_SAME=Both given are the same, therefore cannot merge.
BAD_ZONE=You are accessing a directory through the software (<kbd>{1}</kbd>) which is not a zone. It is not configured as a zone in the software and does not have a &lsquo;pages&rsquo; directory.
CAPTCHA_NO_SESSION=The session for the confirming the CAPTCHA has expired, or never existed. Please start the process again from the start, and if it persists, report this problem, and details of your Internet connection type.

LOW_DISK_SPACE_MAIL=The server is critically low on disk space, with only {1}MB remaining. Check with your webhost or remove some of your files to fix this problem.
COULD_NOT_SAVE_FILE=Could not save <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Are you out of disk space or quota space?
COULD_NOT_SAVE_FILE_TMP=Could not save. Are you out of disk space or quota space? The file failed to save in a temporary directory, {1}, so it could be this directory that is out of quota space.
SHARED_INSTALL_PROHIBIT=You are using a shared install, which makes this action prohibited.
NOTHING_SELECTED=Nothing was selected/chosen, so no operation could be performed.
NOTHING_SELECTED_YET=Nothing was selected/chosen, so no operation can yet be performed.
SD_WARNING_BELOW=If you believe this suspected hack attempt is neither correct nor benign, but rather actually represents a substantial stability problem in the website software, read the information below. Otherwise, do not read on.
NO_SUCH_CONTENT_TYPE=There is no content-type, &lsquo;{1}&rsquo;. For a list of valid content-types see the filenames <kbd>sources/hooks/systems/content_meta_aware</kbd> folder (e.g. presence of <kbd>example.php</kbd> implies <kbd>example</kbd> is a content-type).
LEECH_BLOCK=This request has been blocked because it is a suspected leeching attempt. If you are accessing this entry via the official source (and you haven't bookmarked it, for example), please contact the site staff.
FXML_FIELD_TOO_SHORT=The field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, should be at least {2} {2|character|characters} in length.
FXML_FIELD_PATTERN_FAIL=The field, <kbd>{1}</kbd> did not match the required pattern <kbd>{2}</kbd>.
FXML_FIELD_TOO_LONG=The field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, should be at most {2} {2|character|characters} in length.
FXML_FIELD_SHUNNED=The specified field value for the field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, is disallowed.
FXML_FIELD_SHUNNED_SUBSTRING=The specified field value for the field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, contains a disallowed substring, &ldquo;{2}&rdquo;.

FXML_FIELD_NOT_IN_SET_SECRETIVE=The specified field value for the field, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, does not match one of the allowed values.
XML_NEEDED=The PHP XML extension on your server is needed to use this feature.
GD_NEEDED=The PHP GD extension on your server is needed to use this feature.
FTP_NEEDED=The PHP FTP extension on your server is needed to use this feature.
BAD_ACCESS_DOMAIN=You are accessing via <kbd>{2}</kbd>, but the domain in the base URL is <kbd>{1}</kbd>. Accessing from the wrong domain will cause <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> problems, and JavaScript security errors. You might want to set up a redirect on your web server to guarantee visitors reach the correct domain.
BROKEN_XHTML_FIXED=<p class="red_alert" role="error">This code may have contained non-conformant XHTML. Some display changes were made to avoid crashing this editor.</p>
COOKIE_CONFLICT_DELETE_COOKIES=You have conflicting cookies on your computer. The website can not set cookies as others are stuck in place. Please delete all cookies for this website in your web browser.
NULL_LANG_STRING=The software has been asked to look-up a language string, null. This should not happen and represents a bug.
STOPPED_RECURSIVE_RESOURCE_INCLUDE=There seemed to have been a loop of resource includes of <kbd>{1}</kbd> (e.g. a resource includes itself). The loop has been stopped so the server does not crash.
NOT_IN_PREVIEW_MODE=You are previewing, so button clicks have been disabled.
IMAGE_TOO_LARGE_FOR_THUMB=Sorry, the image is too large (in terms of width and height) for us to generate a thumbnail on the website server. We can handle an image of approximately {1}&times;{2} pixels.
WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE=You have permission to <a href="{1}">see a stack trace for this condition</a>. This error message probably does not indicate a system fault, which is why the stack trace was not shown automatically; however if it is a fault, stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem and thus are great for bug reports.
WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE_2=You have permission to <form class="inline" method="post" action="{1}" autocomplete="off">{2}<div class="inline"><input type="submit" class="button_hyperlink" value="see a stack trace" /></div></form>. This error message probably does not indicate a system fault, which is why the stack trace was not shown automatically; however if it is a fault, stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem and thus are great for bug reports. As the page is POSTed clicking the link will resubmit the form.
WARN_TO_STACK_TRACE_3=You have permission to <a href="{1}">see a stack trace</a>. This error message probably does not indicate a system fault, which is why the stack trace was not shown automatically; however if it is a fault, stack traces help programmers identify the cause of a problem and thus are great for bug reports. Unfortunately you uploaded some files which we can't resend automatically, so the link will take you back to the front page, but if you then go forward to repeat the action you will see a stack trace instead.
NO_PHP_IN_TEMPLATES=The hidden <kbd>allow_php_in_templates</kbd> option is not turned on, so PHP code in templates will not run. The option is described in the Composr Code Book, available from compo.sr. The standard practice for your use case is to create and reference a miniblock, as it separates concerns well, promotes re-usability, and provides a security barrier.
HTACCESS_SEO_PROBLEM=It looks like you have enabled an advanced URL Scheme option and added a custom zone, but may not have edited your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file to refer to the new zone by extending the default rewrite-rules.
NO_INTEGERS_TEMPLATE=Programming error: Integers and/or floats should not be passed into templates (<var>{1}</var>): convert them to strings via <kbd>integer_format</kbd>/<kbd>float_format</kbd>/<kbd>strval</kbd>.
TOO_MANY_USERS_ONLINE=There are too many online users to list.
CANNOT_WILDCARD_START=There are too many users to search like this, please put your wildcard further in the query.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__TOP_ONLY=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the most significant {1} {1|one|ones} here.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__RECENT_ONLY=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the most recent {1} {1|one|ones} here. You can access edit screens from the main website screens (which have paginated results) or the search module.
TOO_MUCH_CHOOSE__ALPHABETICAL=There are too many choices to display, so we have shown the first {1} {1|one|ones} here (alphabetically). You can access edit screens from the main website screens (which have paginated results) or the search module.
MAYBE_NOT_FATAL=You have turned on stack traces for all errors, via having <kbd>keep_fatalistic=1</kbd> in the URL. This means that this may not actually be a fatal error, you have just asked for it to be presented as such (perhaps to help you find where it came from).
FILE_IN_ARCHIVE_TWICE=Cannot add {1} to the archive twice. Archives need to be completely rebuilt to replace a file.
CACHE_NOT_READY_YET=This information has not loaded yet. It will be generated in the background, please come back later.
NOTIFICATION_TYPE_hack_attack=Hacker/bot detected

STOPPED_BY_ANTISPAM=Your IP address ({1}) has been detected in a ban list ({2}). To stop spam we check against external services that log malicious activity across the web. If your IP address has been flagged by accident we apologise &ndash; often IP addresses are shared or recycled so false-positives can occur, but we must protect our systems. If you are a genuine user please run a virus scan, secure your network, and try again in a few days.
IP_BAN_LOG_AUTOBAN_ANTISPAM=Auto-blocked by remote spam list checks ({1})
ERROR_CHECKING_FOR_SPAMMERS=Could not run spam check using the [tt]{1}[/tt] service due to connection error. The action has been let through without a check. The IP involved was [tt]{2}[/tt].
_ERROR_CHECKING_FOR_SPAMMERS=Could not run spam check using the [tt]{1}[/tt] service. The error message returned was: {2}. The action has been let through without a check. The IP involved was [tt]{3}[/tt].

SPAM_REPORT_TRIGGERED_SPAM_HEURISTICS=Multiple triggers to spam heuristics (such as blackholes, or splatter-gun link injection)
SPAM_REPORT_SITE_FLOODING=Flooding POST requests
SPAM_REPORT_NO_EMAIL_OR_USERNAME=Sorry, we can't report this user because either there was no known username, or no known e-mail address. Stop Forum Spam requires full details.
TEMPCODE_NOT_ARRAY=Tempcode error: Not an array!
WORDFILTER_YOU=The word filter has detected a banned word (&lsquo;{1}&rsquo;) and has halted your submission.
NO_SELECTABLE_THEME_IMAGES_MSN=You are running from a multi-site-network satellite which means you need to select an existing theme image for this resource (as uploads would not go to the central site), rather than uploading one. However all theme images from the {1} set seem to be missing.
SUHOSIN_MAX_VALUE_TOO_SHORT=The PHP Suhosin extension is configured with a <kbd>{1}</kbd> setting that is too small. This will stop this form from saving. Please consult the <kbd>recommended.htaccess</kbd> file (if applicable), or your webhost.
SUHOSIN_MAX_VARS_TOO_LOW=The PHP/Suhosin extension is configured with a <kbd>{1}</kbd> setting that is too small. This may stop this form from saving. Please consult the <kbd>recommended.htaccess</kbd> file (if applicable), or your webhost.
_SUHOSIN_MAX_VARS_TOO_LOW=The PHP/Suhosin extension is configured with a <kbd>{1}</kbd> setting that is too small. This has stopped this form from saving. Please consult the <kbd>recommended.htaccess</kbd> file (if applicable), or your webhost.
__SUHOSIN_MAX_VARS_TOO_LOW=The PHP/Suhosin extension is configured with a <kbd>{1}</kbd> setting that is too small.
NOT_ON_GOOGLE_APPENGINE=This function is not available on Google App Engine. Where applicable, use an alternative App Engine-specific process.
NOT_ON_LIVE_GOOGLE_APPENGINE=This function is not available on the live Google App Engine application. Perform the action on the development site, and then re-deploy (for more details see the Installing on Google App Engine tutorial).
IMAP_NEEDED=This functionality requires the PHP <abbr title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr> extension.
IMAP_ERROR=<abbr title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr> error: {1}
BAD_INPUT=The input you gave was invalid.
_BAD_INPUT=The input <kbd>{1}</kbd> is invalid.
DOUBLE_SUBMISSION_PREVENTED=This submission appears to conflict with another very similar submission you made just {3} ago.<br /><br />Perhaps you accidentally clicked the button twice, or refreshed this page in your browser.<br /><br />If we have made a mistake, and you really did intend two very similar submissions, click to Proceed.
NO_GD_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP GD extension on the server (no PHP graphics functionality). Officially Composr requires this, and a number of very useful features will not work without it (such as automatic thumbnail generation).
NO_GD_ON_SERVER_PNG=PHP does not have PNG support built-into the GD library, which is required. This is very unusual. If you have made a custom PHP build you should install the PNG library and rebuild.
NO_GD_ON_SERVER_JPEG=PHP does not have JPEG support built-into the GD library, which is required. This is very unusual. If you have made a custom PHP build you should install the PNG library and rebuild.
NO_GD_ON_SERVER_TTF=PHP does not have TTF support built-into the GD library, which is required. If you have made a custom PHP build you should install the FreeType2 library and rebuild. If you are using a third-party PHP build with unusual settings (such as those on MacOS), you should install an official PHP build.
NO_XML_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP XML availability on the server (the PHP XML extension is not available). This means certain functionality, such as the displaying of <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> and Atom feeds, will not be able to function.
MYSQL_TOO_OLD=You are using a very old version of MySQL ({2}). Officially Composr requires version {1} or higher.
LOW_MEMORY_LIMIT=Your server has a very low PHP memory limit, and the developers cannot guarantee that Composr will be able to function within this limit. Once you have installed, please try renaming the bundled recommended.htaccess file to .htaccess, as this will try and raise the memory limit (if that causes errors, you'll need to rename it back and create a custom php.ini, as described in our FAQ). Composr officially requires a minimum 16MB limit, but 32MB is recommended. If you cannot override or change the limit, consult your webhost; Composr may function to some degree, but problems will occur in numerous areas if more than a little content is added.
SLOW_SERVER=The server seems to have slow CPU performance (right now anyway). A number crunching test performed at just {1}% of the lead developer's development machine.
MOD_SECURITY=You appear to have ModSecurity (or a similar web application firewall) that is blocking some legitimate software requests with a status code of '{1}'. Web application firewalls are legitimate tools but are designed to be configured by expert programmers; unfortunately many webhosts deploy them indiscriminately. We will try and work around the issue on any key screens that are likely to cause false positives but we cannot guarantee this will work perfectly.
MISSING_UTF_SUPPORT=Neither the <kbd>iconv</kbd> nor <kbd>mbstring</kbd> PHP extensions are available. This may lead to some bugs processing non-English languages.
NO_ZIP_ON_SERVER=There is no PHP ZIP extension on the server. Batch importing from ZIP files (this is not a common activity) will not work until ZIP support is enabled/configured (either via the extension, or via configuring Composr to use the InfoZip alternative).
WARNING_DISK_SPACE=You have less than 25MB of disk space remaining.
WARNING_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=Your server is configured to give only a few seconds for the slowest pages to load. This is a cause for concern.
PHP_OLD=PHP version 5.1 or newer is required
WARNING_MBSTRING_FUNC_OVERLOAD=The PHP <kbd>mbstring.func_overload</kbd> setting is not set to <kbd>0</kbd>. This PHP setting is explicitly advised against in the PHP manual and will cause numerous unexpected behaviours inside Composr and other scripts, so needs to be disabled. Unicode works in Composr without this option.
DISABLED_FUNCTION=An important PHP function, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, has been intentionally disabled on this web server. This essentially means the PHP language isn't fully available on this server &ndash; you may not be able to use Composr on it, depending on how the specific function is used.
NONPRESENT_EXTENSION_FUNCTION=An important PHP function, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, is not available, likely due to a required PHP extension being missing.
NO_UPLOAD=PHP must have file uploading enabled
ADBLOCKER=The preview frame seems to be missing. This is probably due to running a browser adblocker plugin.
INTERFERING_AD_SCRIPT=Your HTTP requests to PHP are being interfered with. Perhaps you are on free hosting where adverts get automatically injected into all PHP output. This lack of basic integrity will randomly break many features, particularly AJAX functionality.
JSON_ONLY=Only supported output type is JSON.
INCORRECT_COOKIE_DOMAIN=Incorrect cookie domain of <kbd>{1}</kbd> specified in the website's installation options (access domain is <kbd>{2}</kbd>). Cookies will not be able to save.
INCORRECT_COOKIE_PATH=Incorrect cookie path of <kbd>{1}</kbd> specified in the website's installation options (access path is <kbd>{2}</kbd>). Cookies will not be able to save.
IMPOSSIBLE_TYPE_USED=A block cannot be displayed because it uses a content type which is not usable. You likely uninstalled a module which is required for this content type.
CANNOT_COPY_TO_SERVER=An error occurred while trying to copy the file to the server
NO_DATA_IMPORTED=No data imported

HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM=A problem has been detected with your web server (HTTP code of &ldquo;{3}&rdquo;) that may cause your forms to fail. Some servers are poorly configured, and invisibly redirect traffic from one URL to another, and this invisible redirection results in lost submitted form data. Try changing your base URL{1} so that it {2}.
_WITH_WWW=doesn't contain &ldquo;<kbd>www.</kbd>&rdquo;
_WITHOUT_WWW=contains &ldquo;<kbd>www.</kbd>&rdquo;
_HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM_RUNNING= in the <a target="_blank" href="{1}">config editor</a>
_HTTP_REDIRECT_PROBLEM_INSTALLING=
IP_FORWARDING_CHANGE=Your server is failing to connect to itself through it's base URL, with an error code of &ldquo;{3}&rdquo;. {1} the &ldquo;{2}&rdquo; option.<br />There can be other causes, such as your server blocking web requests to itself. If problems persist, contact your webhost.
_IP_FORWARDING_ENABLED=Try unsetting
_IP_FORWARDING_DISABLED=Try setting
_IP_FORWARDING_INSTALLING=After installing try setting
