[strings]
AUDIO_CAPTCHA_HELP=If you have difficulties filling in this CAPTCHA, please use the linked audio version.
PLAY_AUDIO_VERSION=Play audio version
USE_CAPTCHAS=Use CAPTCHA
CONFIG_OPTION_use_captchas=Use CAPTCHAs (security images) where supported. CAPTCHAs are images with text that must be typed in to proceed. It prevents automated systems spamming your site.
CONFIG_OPTION_captcha_noise=Whether to show noise on CAPTCHA images (CAPTCHA is when your guests enter numbers from an image to confirm submissions). Noise decreases the  likelihood of getting spammed but decreases readability. Note for accessibility reasons there is an audio version of the CAPTCHA feature.
CONFIG_OPTION_captcha_on_feedback=Whether to employ the CAPTCHA facility on the contact blocks. Enabling this removes the ability for users to contact you if for whatever reason they find themselves unable to use the CAPTCHA.
CAPTCHA_ON_FEEDBACK=Use CAPTCHA on feedback blocks
CAPTCHA_NOISE=CAPTCHA noise
CAPTCHA=CAPTCHA
SECURITY_IMAGE=Security image
DESCRIPTION_CAPTCHA=To prevent bots, we require you to duplicate the text shown in the image, in the text box.
DESCRIPTION_CAPTCHA_2=Type in the text from the graphic or {1}.
DESCRIPTION_CAPTCHA_3=Type in the text from the graphic.
AUDIO_VERSION=audio version
FORM_TIME_SECURITY=You have 30 minutes to complete this form before the CAPTCHA will expire.
INVALID_SECURITY_CODE_ENTERED=The security code entered is not valid. Unfortunately you must go back and try again, and hopefully you will be able to discern the image correctly. If you continue to have problems, please try the audio version, or contact the staff.
NO_SESSION_SECURITY_CODE=Your session seems to have expired since loading the page. This may be due to an unstable IP address. Please go back, refresh the page, and try again.
CONFIG_OPTION_captcha_single_guess=If enabled users should only get one guess at each CAPTCHA image (recommended for good security).
CONFIG_OPTION_css_captcha=If enabled then the CAPTCHA will be generated using pixels defined in CSS. This puts more load on the browser, but it makes it harder for spammers to feed images into their <abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> software.
CSS_CAPTCHA=CSS CAPTCHA image
CAPTCHA_SINGLE_GUESS=One guess per CAPTCHA image
AUDIO_CAPTCHA=Audio CAPTCHA
CONFIG_OPTION_audio_captcha=Enable an audio version of the CAPTCHA. This is important for accessibility purposes, but does lower CAPTCHA security because it is easier to crack.
JS_CAPTCHA=JavaScript CAPTCHA
CONFIG_OPTION_js_captcha=Require JavaScript for the CAPTCHA to be revealed. This puts a dependency on JavaScript, but improves security because CAPTCHA solvers will not be able to scan a pure web-page render to find a CAPTCHA. The option is not enabled by default as some ad blockers may think the dynamic iframe is an advertisement.
