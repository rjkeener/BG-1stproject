DOC_TRACKBACKS=Trackbacks are links from content on one website to content on another website. They are created when an author of a new piece of content creates their new content in reference to yours &ndash; in this sense, trackbacks are a way for your visitors to find who has quoted your content. Trackbacks are usually used to link blog articles, but may be used in this software for any type of content. Unfortunately one problem with trackbacks is spam &ndash; web spiders often will create fake trackbacks on sites to try and lead your visitors to. This software has facilities to minimise this spam, but you may wish to manually delete spam trackbacks if they do happen. Trackbacks can be enabled or disabled in the configuration, or for any individual content entry.
