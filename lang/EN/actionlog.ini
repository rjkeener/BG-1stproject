DOC_REVISIONS=View old content text that has been lost through edits or deletes. This by default is implemented only for Wiki+ (pages and posts) and Conversr (topics and posts), but is provided by a framework within the software and hence is extensible. The functionality is useful for restoring accidental loses, or investigating malicious activity that might have been covered up.
ABOUT_REVISIONS=This screen shows all the edits and deletes matching the search filter. From here old content versions can be reviewed and historic records may be deleted.<br /><br />The action log has a wider set of actions and will link through to revisions for some of those actions also &ndash; revisions are a more specific concept. Edits to Comcode pages will not show here as these revisions are stored on disk rather than in the database &ndash; but those can be found when editing a particular page or via the action log.
