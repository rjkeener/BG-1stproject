ABSTRACT_FILE_MANAGEMENT=Details required for file management
TEXT_ABSTRACT_FILE_MANAGEMENT=You are about to perform a file management function, and the website software needs to know how it may proceed to do this. On most web server configurations it is necessary to perform this kind of file management via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>. You need to enter the details for your environment accordingly.<br />The software should not usually be told to store your FTP password because it erodes your security, but if security is less of an issue for you, you can tell it to store it at your own risk.
NEED_FTP=Need to connect through FTP
DESCRIPTION_NEED_FTP=Leave this ticked (checked) if you can only manipulate the software's primary files through FTP. This is the case for nearly all Linux/UNIX servers. If PHP may directly manipulate the files, you may untick (uncheck) the box and not enter any FTP details.
REMEMBER_PASSWORD=Remember password
DESCRIPTION_REMEMBER_PASSWORD=It is highly recommended that you <strong>do not</strong> use this option, as it will lead to your password being stored in plain-text on the server (meaning anyone with an account on the same server can probably read it and hence assume your access).
