SUPER_DEBRAND=Debranding
REBRAND_NAME=Brand name

REBRAND_BASE_URL=Brand base-URL
COMPANY_NAME=Company name
DELETE_UN_PC=Delete inappropriate emoticons/avatars
DESCRIPTION_DELETE_UN_PC=Delete inappropriate emoticons and avatars; at this time, this only deletes the &lsquo;devil&rsquo; emoticon.
ADMINGUIDE=Admin Guide
ADMINGUIDE_DEFAULT_TRAINING=[title]Administrative Guide[/title]\n\nThis system is designed to be self-explanatory for those with a high enough level of computer skills. If you need additional help, please contact __company__ for guidance; you may wish to enquire about hands-on training.
DESCRIPTION_ADMINGUIDE=An Admin Guide for this user. The default is one that just refers them to training.
REBRAND_DASHBOARD=[title]Admin Zone[/title]\n\nWelcome to the Admin Zone for your website. You will find icons relating to the functions you may perform to manage your website in the &lsquo;Options&rsquo; section.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_debrand=Debranding
DOC_SUPERDEBRAND=You may, should you wish to, remove almost all references to Composr from the administrative areas of this website, so that users of the Content Management and Admin Zones will see the branding of your own choice.\n\nThis functionality is designed for those building websites for third parties; in this situation it is recommended that you give the third party super-moderator access (rather than give full super-administrator access) and limit Admin Zone access permissions (automatically done to an extent).
WARNING_SUPER_DEBRAND_MAJOR_CHANGES=See the help on the right for a description of this feature. One further thing you might want to do after running this tool is to customise your zone logos, as these will continue to mention Composr until you change them.
DESCRIPTION_BRAND_BASE_URL=The base URL for the new software 'brand' (e.g. <kbd>http://compo.sr</kbd>). Please note that the software documentation must be available under the <kbd>{1}</kbd> directory of this brand base URL. The documentation is available from the official website (under 'Addons') in Comcode page form. You need to create a redirect from <kbd>{1}</kbd> to <kbd>docs</kbd>, as we supply it in the <kbd>docs</kbd> zone but link to it as <kbd>{1}</kbd>. You may download and customise it.
DESCRIPTION_SHOW_DOCS=Whether to include tutorial links in the Admin and CMS zones (these will point to the documentation under your brand base URL).
