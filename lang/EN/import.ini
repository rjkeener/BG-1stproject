[strings]
DOC_IMPORT=An integrated importer system is provided, which allows merging of content stored in any supported data format into a running site. This merging process allows combination of any number of supported websites, to form a single combined website.
ATTACHMENT_REFERENCES=Attachment references
COMPOSR_SITE_MERGER=Composr site merger
MERGE=merge
USER_ONLINE_TRACKING=User-online tracking
MISSING_PHOTO=Missing photo: {1}
MISSING_ATTACHMENT=Missing attachment: {1}
MISSING_AVATAR=Missing avatar: {1}
MEMBER_FILES=Member files (e.g. avatars, personal photos)
POST_FILES=Post files (e.g. attachments)
IMPORT_SESSION=Import session
DESCRIPTION_IMPORT_SESSION=You may resume prior import sessions (if there are any), or create a new one.
IMPORT_SESSION_NEW=Create a new import session
IMPORT_SESSION_NEW_DELETE=Create a new import session, and delete all old sessions
IMPORT_SESSION_NEW_DELETE_CNS_SATELLITE=Import another site that shared prior imported forum
IMPORT_SESSION_EXISTING_REMAP=Resume the previous import session ({1})
IMPORT_SESSION_CURRENT=Continue the current import session ({1})
REFRESH_TIME=Refresh time
DESCRIPTION_REFRESH_TIME=It is not easy for web systems to import large bodies of data, because they work on a page request model. PHP/Browsers will time-out if a page takes too long to load: halting the import. Our import system is re-entrant and automatically reloads: please enter the number of seconds between requests.
IMPORT_OF_SKIPPED=Import of <kbd>{1}</kbd> is skipped for now because it depends on <kbd>{2}</kbd> to be completed. You should go back and re-import this once the dependency has been satisfied.
IMPORT_NOT_IMPORTED=We cannot continue due to a missing dependency. <kbd>{2}</kbd> of type <kbd>{1}</kbd> is missing. There may be a small corruption in your database &ndash; if you contact us (the developers) with a copy of the database, we may be able to work around it and get you an updated importer.
IMPORT_WARNING=It is recommended that you only import one thing at a time, to reduce the effect of failure. The importer system is designed to be very robust and streamlined, but the wide variety of data presented to it leads to the occasional difficulty. If you find the importer will not import your data, we may be able to assist you; please contact the developers.
FROM_IMPORTING_SYSTEM=File-system path to the import source. This must point to a working installation of the software.
_FROM_IMPORTING_SYSTEM=Part of the access details for the Composr database. This must be a correct specifier of where the database of the Composr site being imported is currently located.
IMPORTER=Importer
DESCRIPTION_IMPORTER=The importer relevant to what you wish to import.
SELECT_TO_IMPORT=Select which things you would like to import:
EPHEMS=Ephems
SWITCH_TO_CNS=Switch to <abbr title="The Composr Forum system, our integrated forum/member system">Conversr</abbr> (available as you are importing a forum currently active by forum driver)
CNS_CONVERTED_INFO=Converted <kbd>_config.php</kbd> to use Conversr (it is likely that you will need to logout, then back in now)
IMPORT_SELF_NO=You cannot merge a site with itself (you used the site's own database and table prefix as the import source)
ERROR_NOT_CORRECT_DATABASE=The database specified was not correct for the importer. If you see an SQL error stated above, it is likely a database was specified that does not exist.
ERROR_NOT_CORRECT_VERSION=The database contained an unexpected data version.
ERROR_NOT_CORRECT_LINKING=The target data is linked to an alien member/usergroup system. If importing continues, members and usergroups will not be automatically correctly associated with any imported data.
ERROR_NOT_CORRECT_LINKING_POSSIBLY=The target data is linked to may be from an alien member/usergroup system (it can't be automatically detected, due to the warning stated above). If importing continues, members and usergroups will not be automatically correctly associated with any imported data.
ERROR_NOT_CORRECT_FILES=The file path specified did not point to a correct installation.
ERROR_INACCESSIBLE_DIR=The file path specified could not be read from, due to PHP security permissions.
IMPORT_WARNINGS_GIVEN=You've been given some warnings. Continuing will ignore these warnings, and may result in problems.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_import=Import
FORUM_PASSWORD_TO_INTRO_QUESTION=You need a password to enter this forum.
IMPORT_WARNING_CONVERT=Misbehaviour in post #{1}
BAD_IMPORT_PATH=The given import path is not correct (the <kbd>{1}</kbd> file is not there).
IMPORT_ALL_FINISHED=<strong>Everything has now been imported!</strong><br /><br />{1}
_IMPORT_ALL_FINISHED=<strong>Everything has now been imported!</strong>
RSS=RSS
REDIRECTED_TO_CACHE_MODULES=You have been redirected to an area of the software that can import this kind of data.
THEME_TO_SAVE_INTO=The theme to save our templating changes into. The colour scheme of this theme should match the colour scheme of the site you are importing (the Theme Wizard can help you easily create a theme with a colour scheme) so that it fits nicely. Be aware that if you already have a customised <kbd>GLOBAL_HTML_WRAP.tpl</kbd> then your customisations will be overwritten.
DESCRIPTION_WHETHER_CONVERT_COMCODE=The converter will create Comcode pages for you, but if you choose this option then the pages will be tidier, but at the risk of some of the precision in the original HTML being lost.
DESCRIPTION_FIX_INVALID_HTML=Whether to fix invalid HTML/XHTML when importing.
DESCRIPTION_IMPORT_BASE_URL=The URL the site used to be hosted on. This will be used to simplify old hard-coded absolute URLs and make your site more transferrable.
WHETHER_CONVERT_COMCODE=Whether to convert HTML to Comcode
FIX_INVALID_HTML=Fix invalid HTML
NO_PAGES_FOUND=We could not find any pages under the directory you specified.
MISSING_IMPORT_SESSION=Could not find the import session. Have you started it from the main UI yet?
TOO_MANY_IMPORT_SESSIONS=There is more than one import sessions, so you need to specify the session ID as a parameter.
CMD_CONTINUE_IMPORT_HELP=Continue and complete a full import session you've already initiate. Designed to be run when Commandr is running from PHP's CLI mode (meaning you need shell access). This is advanced experimental functionality, intended for importing large websites, and will not work for everybody.
CMD_CONTINUE_IMPORT_HELP_PARAM_0=The target database password.
CMD_CONTINUE_IMPORT_HELP_PARAM_1=The session ID. (Optional)
CANNOT_MERGE_CATALOGUES=Both sites have a catalogue with the same codename (<kbd>{1}</kbd>). We cannot merge these catalogues. Please rename the catalogue on one of the sites first. If you wish to merge them, you can do a CSV export and re-import.
