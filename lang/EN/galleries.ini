DOC_GALLERY_IMPORT=It is possible to fill a gallery with the images and videos contained within a ZIP or TAR file. This is a very useful feature to quickly fill a gallery; an example usage might be to put all images on a digital camera memory card into an archive file, and to upload the file.\nWhen importing a gallery this way, no descriptions are added for the entries. However it is possible to add descriptions, and customise other details, simply by editing the entries individually.\n\nThere is an additional "import to gallery" feature that works on the premise that any image or video file located in the [tt]uploads/galleries[/tt] directory should be pointed to by an entry in the system. Any such file that is not pointed to, is labelled as an 'orphaned file', and the import feature allows such files to be chosen selectively and imported into any gallery. This is useful because you can upload large file sets directly to [tt]uploads/galleries[/tt] and then batch-add them.
DOC_GALLERIES=A gallery system is provided for the storage, organisation and viewing of images and videos. The gallery serves much like a gallery in reality: as a direct presentation medium.

If the number of sub-galleries exceeds this number then sub-galleries will not be linked to directly from the parent gallery.

TRANSCODING=Video Transcoding
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_TRANSCODING=Transcoding is the process of converting from one video format to another. The software has built-in support for all common browser plugins on all platforms. However, only h.264 files reliably play across all platforms. FLV files also play across most platforms. If you set up one of the three methods of transcoding below, the software will ask the transcoding service to convert all non-websafe files (everything except <kbd>mp3</kbd>, <kbd>mp4</kbd> [assumed to be properly encoded h.264 video with mp3 sound track, in an mp4 container], <kbd>webm</kbd>, and <kbd>flv</kbd>). You don't <em>need</em> to set up transcoding, it can be hard, or have a cost, and won't work on all servers &ndash; an alternative is to simply educate your users to only upload properly encoded MP4/h.264-video/mp3-audio files, although understand exactly what this entails and explaining it is a problem in itself.
FFMPEG_PATH=FFMPEG path
CONFIG_OPTION_ffmpeg_path=Fill this in if you want to allow transcoding using a copy of FFMPEG installed on the server, immediately after upload. Provide the path to the <kbd>ffmpeg</kbd> tool, with a trailing slash. E.g. <kbd>/usr/bin/</kbd>. FFMPEG is very unreliable, but this is the easiest option to set up.
TRANSCODING_SERVER=Composr transcoding server
CONFIG_OPTION_transcoding_server=The URL to an install of the Composr transcoding server, which is available as an addon. However, it is highly recommended that you do not use this (it uses FFMPEG which is very unreliable), and you use zencoder instead. It is better than the simple &ldquo;FFMPEG path&rdquo; option as transcoding requests are properly queued, ensuring a smooth running service.
TRANSCODING_ZENCODER_API_KEY=Zencoder API key
CONFIG_OPTION_transcoding_zencoder_api_key=A <a href="http://zencoder.com/">zencoder</a> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> key. Zencoder is a commercial transcoding service that is very reliable and recommended for serious users. As of September 2014, Zencoder support is <strong>no longer operational</strong>, as the API we use has been disabled for new users. Our support needs to be rewritten.
TRANSCODING_ZENCODER_FTP_PATH=Zencoder FTP path
CONFIG_OPTION_transcoding_zencoder_ftp_path=An <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> URL with write access to the <kbd>uploads/galleries</kbd> directory (e.g. <kbd>ftp://username:password@yourdomain/uploads/galleries</kbd>) that zencoder can use to deliver transcoded files to.
AUDIO_BITRATE=Audio bitrate
VIDEO_BITRATE=Video bitrate
CONFIG_OPTION_video_bitrate=The bitrate video should be transcoded to, in kbps.
CONFIG_OPTION_audio_bitrate=The bitrate audio should be transcoded to, in kbps.
TRANSCODING_IN_PROGRESS=Your media is now in our queue for converting to the most compatible play-back format. Meanwhile we will try and make the file playable in the format it was uploaded with.
TRANSCODING_ERROR=Your media failed to be sent for transcoding. If this problem persists please contact us.
TRANSCODING_ERROR_2=Your media failed to be transcoded, probably due to an unusual or invalid encoding, or a corrupt file.
TRANSCODING_LOCALHOST=Cannot receive zencoder transcoded files while running on localhost. The transcode request has been sent and you may upload the transcoded file manually again (don't rename it or the system won't recognise it as an already-transcoded file).
WILL_CONTINUE_AFTER_VIDEO_FINISHED=Waiting for video to finish
VIDEO_WAS_AUTO_IMPORTED=Video was imported via GALLERY_VIDEO_FOR_URL symbol
