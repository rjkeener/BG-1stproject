[strings]
DOC_WORDFILTER=There is a simple word filter which will allow you to prevent a list of words from appearing on your site, unless the user that posts them has the privilege to bypass the word filter.
OBSCENITY_WARNING=This page allows management of filtered words. Be warned that by expanding the page interface, you will be subjected to a list of these words: if you or people close to you might be offended by such a list, hold-back this action. This software is pre-programmed with a default list, that we feel most English speaking websites would want filtering; depending on your website's level of liberalism or censorship, or your language, you may wish to make major changes to the list.
MANAGE_WORDFILTER=Manage word filter
ADD_WORDFILTER=Add to word filter
DELETE_WORDFILTER=Delete word from word filter
WORDFILTER=Word filter
DESCRIPTION_WORD=The word to be filtered.
REPLACEMENT=Replacement
DESCRIPTION_REPLACEMENT=The string you'd like to act as a replacement (e.g. &lsquo;s*hit&rsquo;). Leave this blank if the words presence is to cause the form submission to be blocked, rather than altered.
WORD_SUBSTR=Substring-match
DESCRIPTION_WORD_SUBSTR=Whether to block the word appearing within other words. Be very careful with this, as turning it on could block unexpected things. For instance, the company name &lsquo;Matsushita&rsquo; would be blocked for a common 4-letter swear word.
HELP_ADD_WORDFILTER=Add new words to the word filter below. You may also specify how the word will be matched, and treated.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_wordfilter=Manage word filter
DESCRIPTION_HAVE_DEFAULT_WORDFILTER=Keep the default filter list of filtered swear/obscene words.
KEEP_WORDFILTER=Block common swear words
