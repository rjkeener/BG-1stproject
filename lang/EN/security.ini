[strings]
DOC_SECURITY_LOG=The software monitors all web requests for potential security violations and thoroughly logs all suspicious activity. In addition, failed logins are logged, so that you can see if users are trying to illicitly access the accounts of members.
SECURITY_LOG=Security logging
FAILED_LOGINS=Failed logins
SECURITY_ALERTS=Security alerts
VIEW_ALERT=View security alert ({1})
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_types=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which may be uploaded by users. Leave blank if you want to just apply core security restrictions, and nothing further.
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_images=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which are valid images for inline display. Note that adding new file types won't necessarily work because PHP's GD library will need to support them (thumbnail generation), and the web browser will need to know how to display them using a normal <kbd>img</kbd> element.
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_videos=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which are valid videos for inline display. Note that adding new file types won't necessarily work because the software's media API may not have a handler for them, might not have defined mime-types for them, or web browser's may not all support them. Note that the software defines &ldquo;video&rdquo; <em>very</em> broadly, including some document formats.
CONFIG_OPTION_valid_audios=A comma-separated list (no spaces) of the file types which are valid audio files for inline playback. Note that adding new file types won't necessarily work because the software's media API may not have a handler for them, might not have defined mime-types for them, or web browser's may not all support them.
SECURITY_PAGE_CLEANUP=You may tick-off (check-off) alerts that you wish to erase from the record. Typically this is useful if you have confirmed the alerts to be false alarms and do not want to see them again in the future.
POST_DATA_EXPLANATION=Any web request can be classified as either a &lsquo;GET&rsquo; request or a &lsquo;POST&rsquo; request. &lsquo;GET&rsquo; requests are carried out purely via a URL, while &lsquo;POST&rsquo; requests include additional data. The following data was posted when the security alert was raised&hellip;
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_security=Security logging
HACKER_DETECTED=Hacker/evil-bot: {1}
