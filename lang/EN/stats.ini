DOC_PAGE_STATISTICS=This statistics screen shows a graph of the view counts of different pages, with a text-listing of the same statistics below, with links to per-page breakdowns. The graph displayed is a bar graph, and orders pages from highest to lowest view counts. Such data is invaluable in working out how popular each page on your site is, which can point to problems with some pages.
DOC_USERS_ONLINE_STATISTICS=This statistics screen shows a line-graph of the number of users online for each day, with a text-listing of the same statistics below. Such data can be used to analyse when greater or fewer numbers of people come to visit your site. Please note it can only detect when user online records are set, not keep a constant track -- i.e. you will see increasing peaks, but will not see if it goes down.
DOC_SUBMISSION_STATISTICS=This statistics screen shows a line-graph of the number of submissions for each day, with a text-listing of the same statistics below. Such data can be used to analyse when (and why) people submit to your site.
DOC_LOAD_TIMES=This statistics screen shows a bar chart of how long each page (at minimum) takes to be generated and outputted. This is useful for optimising your site; finding bottlenecks and jams, where things could be spread out more (e.g. putting fifteen blocks on different pages, instead of the same one).
DOC_TOP_REFERRERS=This statistics screen shows a pie chart of the top referrers to the site, with a text-listing of the same statistics below. Such data is invaluable in finding out where to get your site advertised, which advertising schemes aren't working, etc.
DOC_TOP_SEARCH_KEYWORDS=This statistics screen shows a pie chart of the top Google keywords used to find the site, with a text-listing of the same statistics below. Such data helps you see how to refine your website to be better in tune with what people are searching for.
DOC_INSTALL_GEOLOCATION_DATA=The software comes with a large list of mappings that allow it to determine where on the planet (with a reasonable degree of accuracy) an IP address is. This allows more detailed statistics concerning placement of members and visitors. However, this list is too long to sensibly be installed when the software is installed, so it has to be installed separately.
DOC_STATISTICS=It's always nice to be able to summarise your site's activity: average visitor counts, which search engine terms are finding your site, the browsers your visitors are using, and so on. You can view all the collected statistics using charts.

HIT=Hit to {1}

STORE_TIME=Stats retention time
CONFIG_OPTION_stats_store_time=The number of days for which statistics are kept. The default value for this option is kept very low because some webhosts impose tight database limits and then ban accounts that exceed them. To be frank, most shared webhosts can't accept a high value here &ndash; for instance, for 365 days you'll probably use at least 250MB of database storage. This is one of the reasons we recommend you use Google Analytics in addition to the inbuilt statistics (you could also use the stats package bundled with your hosting, but these are usually very basic).
PEAK=Peak
NO_DATA=There is no data available for the selected statistics. Note that data from your own IP address is filtered out.
