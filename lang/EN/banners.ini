DOC_BANNERS=The banner system lets you set up one or more banners to display. It allows 'rotating' (randomising) these banners, with various related control options. The system is designed to be flexible, such that it can serve a number of different purposes, including:\n - Serving banners directly from a third-party banner network, via the [abbr="HyperText Markup Language"]HTML[/abbr] they provide for you to include in your site\n - Serving your own set of banners (perhaps paid banners, or perhaps community banners)\n - Serving community banners, bought via the Point Store\n - Creating your own banner network between independent sites, where sites get as many views/clicks out as they provide in (i.e. a banner exchange program)
HAVE_DEFAULT_BANNERS_DONATION=Have the donation banner
DESCRIPTION_HAVE_DEFAULT_BANNERS_DONATION=This banner is intended for non-profit sites that accept donations.

DESCRIPTION_HAVE_DEFAULT_BANNERS_ADVERTISING=This banner is intended for business sites that offer advertising.
BANNER_TYPES=Banner types
BANNER_TYPE=Banner type
_DESCRIPTION_BANNER_TYPE=A banner will only be shown if the <kbd>banner.php</kbd> script is called up asking to display banners of its type (the &lsquo;Default&rsquo; type is the default). An example banner type might be &lsquo;skyscraper&rsquo;, and those would be shown if <kbd>{$BANNER,skyscraper}</kbd> was placed in an appropriate place in the templates.

Fallback banners are shown only when there are no active banners with the other deployment agreements.
DESCRIPTION_BANNER_TYPE_2=The banner type codename (no spaces, punctuation, or capital letters).<br />The banner type codename used in the default global template is blank.
DESCRIPTION_IMPORTANCE_MODULUS=This determines how regularly the banner will show. A good way to think of it is if you add all the importance moduli of the different banners and consider that a number of minutes (currently <span id="im_total" class="im_{1}">{1}</span>), this banner will on average show for the given number of those total minutes (<span id="im_here">{2}</span>).<br />In short: this banner will show for <span id="im_here_2">{2}</span> out of <span id="im_total_2" class="im_{1}">{1}</span> minutes.
HITS_ALLOCATED=Allocated hits
IMPORTANCE_MODULUS=Importance modulus
_IMPORTANCE_MODULUS=<abbr title="Importance modulus">&Omega;</abbr>

BANNER_CLICKTHROUGH=<abbr title="Click-through rate">CTR</abbr>
DESCRIPTION_BANNER_URL=The URL to which this banner is pointing. Leave this blank if you are entering direct code or want to link to a banner rotation script (the Image URL should be given the URL to the rotation script).
DESCRIPTION_BANNER_NAME=The name associated with this banner (e.g. your product name).

PRIVILEGE_banner_free=Avoid banners
CONFIG_OPTION_use_banner_permissions=Whether to allow banners to have view permissions (defineable on &lsquo;edit banner&rsquo; forms). This is off by default as it has a performance cost. This is useful for various things, including censorship: you could have more explicit banners that are only seen by those in an &lsquo;Adults&rsquo; usergroup.
BANNER_TITLE_TEXT=Title text / trigger text
DESCRIPTION_BANNER_TITLE_TEXT=The title text for textual banners (NB: you can only add textual banners to a banner type that has been configured for them). Also serves as the hot-text in Comcode that will trigger the banner to be shown inline/contextually (only applies if the textual banner type also has &ldquo;Works as Comcode hot-text&rdquo; enabled).
BANNER_TOO_LARGE=This banner is too large ({1} KB). The defined limit for this banner type is {2} KB.

DEPLOYMENT_AGREEMENT=Deployment agreement
DEPLOYMENT_DETERMINATION=Deployment determination
SOURCE_MEDIA=Source media and text
ADD_BANNER_TEMPLATING= <strong>Please be aware that new banner types need to be tied into your site</strong> (by default only the &ldquo;Default&rdquo; banners are shown). Please see the documentation for more information on this.
DESTINATION_URL=Destination URL
DESCRIPTION_URL_BANNER=If you want to supply an existing image URL, or you want to point the banner to a rotation script. If you use a banner script you must use an absolute URL.
PERMISSION_BANNER_SKIP=You have permission to avoid banners, thus you will not see any banners display on this website even if there are some active ones. Super-administrators always have this permission. If you'd like to test your banners you'll need to use another member account.
IMPROPERLY_FILLED_IN_UPLOAD_BANNERS=You did not provide an upload or you tried to upload a file that exceeds the file-size limit, and you did not specify an image URL either. As you were adding to a non-textual banner type you needed to specify a valid upload or URL.
IMPROPERLY_FILLED_IN_BANNERS=You tried to submit to a textual banner type but did not fill in the 'Title text / trigger text' field.
CONFIG_OPTION_banner_autosize=Enable this if you do not want the software to force banner media files to be of a certain inherent size, and instead use HTML to force widths. This option will not preserve aspect ratio, only fit-to-width. This option is particularly useful if you have to reference external media files (e.g. image-view tracking URLs) and thus have no control over the exact dimensions.
CONFIG_OPTION_admin_banners=Whether to show banners to administrators (this is like denying them the permission to avoid banners, and this option exists to bypass that normally you cannot deny administrators any permission).
BANNER_AUTOSIZE=HTML banner resizing
ADMIN_BANNERS=Show banners to admins
BANNER_CLICKED=Banner clicked
BUT_EXPIRED= (but expired)
PRIVILEGE_use_html_banner=Place an HTML banner (dangerous!)
