DOC_AGGREGATE_TYPES=Aggregate content types are complex content structures that you can replicate them out as you require. It is very useful for the quick creation of sophisticated template-based sub-sites, for example. Aggregate content types are an advanced feature, and require an understanding of [acronym="eXtensible Markup Language"]XML[/acronym].
AGGREGATE_TYPES=Aggregate content types
AGGREGATE_TYPE=Aggregate content type
AGGREGATE_TYPE_INSTANCE=Aggregate content type instance
AGGREGATE_TYPE_INSTANCES=Aggregate content type instances
ADD_AGGREGATE_TYPE_INSTANCE=Add aggregate content type instance
EDIT_AGGREGATE_TYPE_INSTANCE=Edit aggregate content type instance
EDIT_THIS_AGGREGATE_TYPE_INSTANCE=Edit this aggregate content type instance
DELETE_AGGREGATE_TYPE_INSTANCE=Delete aggregate content type instance
DUPLICATE_AGGREGATE_INSTANCE=You already have an aggregate content type instance labelled &ldquo;{1}&rdquo;
EDIT_AGGREGATE_TYPES=Edit aggregate types
DESCRIPTION_LABEL=The main label (parameter) for the new aggregate content type instance.
SYNCHRONISE_AGGREGATE_TYPES=Synchronise aggregate types
SELECT_AGGREGATE_TYPES_FOR_SYNC=Select the aggregate content type(s) you'd like to sync instances of. Synching will update all instances to be consistent with the latest XML definition. If you've removed resources from the XML definition, those resources will remain &ndash; only resources/properties added or changed will be affected.
MISSING_AGGREGATE_TYPE=Could not find the aggregate content type, {1}. Maybe it was deleted from the XML prior to this instance being created?
MISSING_CONTENT_TYPE_TEMPLATE=The content type (<kbd>{1}</kbd>) template &lsquo;{2}&rsquo; (in {3}) was not found.
MISSING_CONTENT_TYPE=The content type (<kbd>{1}</kbd>) was not found.
UNKNOWN_PRIVILEGE_PRESET=Did not recognise the privilege preset, <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
DELETE_AGGREGATE_MATCHES=Delete matches
DESCRIPTION_DELETE_AGGREGATE_MATCHES=Whether to delete all resources that are linked to this instance. Use with great caution, as this will delete anything created within the resources (e.g. comments, or entries), and it will delete it all regardless of whether it existed before the instance or not. Take a backup!
