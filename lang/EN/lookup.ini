DOC_INVESTIGATE_USER=This lookup page finds information relating to a website user. It's purpose is as a hub for information. The primary screen for managing a joined member is the member's profile screen.\n\nThe software has tried to pull together as much as it can, by trying to match against the triad of [b]IP address[/b], [b]member ID[/b], and [b]username[/b]/[b]author[/b]. Links are provided that correspond to each of these, each link providing a different perspective on what is likely a single user.\n\nIf you would like to provide a low-level ban against IP address it is advisable to carefully research the usages of each IP address set by performing additional IP-based lookups (following the IP addresses as linked will lead you to do this).
