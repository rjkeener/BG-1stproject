Authors are distinct from normal member profiles- in fact, there is nothing to say an author of an entry is even present on your website (it may have been submitted by a member, but authored by a company, for example). i.e. There is no guarantee that an author of an entry is going to have a member account on the system.

The following types of content support the author system:
 - news
 - downloads
Association between authors and members is supported, either automatically by sharing a common name (author=username) or by manual configuration. If Conversr (the inbuilt forum and member system) is used then this binding is strongest as a link to a members associated author profile (if it exists) is presented on said member's profile screen.";s:22:"VIEW_MY_AUTHOR_PROFILE";s:17:"My author profile";s:22:"EDIT_MY_AUTHOR_PROFILE";s:20:"Setup author profile";s:13:"AUTHOR_MANAGE";s:17:"Author management";s:13:"MERGE_AUTHORS";s:13:"Merge authors";s:25:"DESCRIPTION_MEMBER_AUTHOR";s:284:"The username of the author's member account, if you prefer.
