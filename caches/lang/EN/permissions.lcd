This could be used, for example, to allow members to browse through download categories but not actually view any download entry.
The match-key permission system is not intended to be used unless really needed - it is there to provide additional control when page and privileges won't meet your unique needs.

To add a new match-key permission, go to the "Match-key page restriction" icon in the Security section of the Admin Zone.

An example match-key that would deny access for viewing download entries would be: [tt]_WILD:downloads:entry[/tt]. Usergroups could be checked to deny members in those usergroups access to the website screen that actually views a download ([tt]type=entry[/tt] is that interface).

At the bottom of the same screen you can choose what error message to display if someone is denied access.
