Many events could lead to the destruction of your data, including:
 - hard disk corruption (perhaps 30% of cheap hard disks which are under constant use develop physical corruption problems \[I made the statistic up, but based on my experience, it is about right])
 - fire or other physical disaster
 - accidental damage
 - malicious damage
 - accidental loss of files
 - webhosts going out of business
 - having a hard-disk seized (if for example the site is unfortunately hosted on the same web server as a police suspect)
 - bugs in software (it is possible BeatGrid contains bugs which could cause data loss, and we do not accept liability for losses due to this, as users should have adequate backups and it is impossible for us to test all software usage scenarios)";s:13:"DOC_BACKUPS_2";s:362:"Remember [b]don't just take backups, test them too[/b]!
