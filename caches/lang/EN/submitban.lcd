Addresses may contain &lsquo;wildcards&rsquo; (asterisks) between dotted segments to symbolize that any number in that segment will match.

It is usual to have an asterisk as the final (fourth) part, as a user's IP address is very likely to change in that final component and at the same time it is very unlikely that wildcarding that last portion would result in any unintended bans.
