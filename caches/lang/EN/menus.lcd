[surround][title="3"]A note on accessibility[/title]

When writing for any kind of publication, it is important to use clear language which is appropriate for the audience you are targeting. Using good grammar and spelling not only makes your text correct, but most importantly, it makes it easier to read and understand - a small conscious effort will lead to a significant improvement for all your readers.

For your text to be accessible to those with certain kinds of disability, you should make sure:
 - color is not used alone to convey information
 - text is well-spaced into logical paragraphs
 - if you are writing a long piece of text, consider using headings and an index (the software can maintain the index for you if you use the 'contents' Comcode tag)
 - Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first occurs
 - Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings, paragraphs, and lists, so that your text may be quickly understood on its first read
 - use clear, precise, and understandable language: avoid complex words unless there is a good reason for them[/surround]";s:9:"DOC_MENUS";s:269:"'Menus' usually reside either in the header, or on panel-pages ('panels') placed around the main section of the website.
