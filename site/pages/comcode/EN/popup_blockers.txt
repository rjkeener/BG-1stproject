[title="2"]Web browsers[/title]

Often web browsers come built-in with pop-up blockers, so you'll need to grant permission. Your web browser is the software you use for viewing websites, it's what you're using now.

[title="3"]Microsoft Edge / Microsoft Internet Explorer[/title]

If you are a Windows user and haven't installed a new web browser, you are probably using the standard one: Microsoft Edge or Microsoft Internet Explorer.

[title="3"]Apple Safari[/title]

Safari has no per-website control over blocking pop-ups windows. Pop-ups are either blocked, or they are not. To allow pop-ups:
 - From the [b]Safari[/b] menu, click [b]Preferences[/b] ([tt]Cmd[/tt]+[tt],[/tt])
 - Click [b]Security[/b]
 - Make sure [b]Block pop-up windows[/b] is unchecked

You should go back and check [b]Block pop-up windows[/b] when you are done using the site for the day, to avoid inconvenience if other websites abuse pop-up windows.

You may wish to install a more featured web browser, such as Google Chrome for greater convenience.

[title="2"]Browser extensions / addons[/title]

It is also possible you have installed your own pop-up blocker into your web browser. If this is the case then you'll need to configure that to allow pop-ups from [semihtml]<kbd>{$BASE_URL*}</kbd>[/semihtml].
