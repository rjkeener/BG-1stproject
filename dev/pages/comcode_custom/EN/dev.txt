What to help out BeatGrid, then you are in luck. To be a developer, you have two (2) choices.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. You can develop&nbsp;the apps on your own and submit them to the BeatGrid CTO and have it go through test and virus Checks.&nbsp;<img alt=":shake:" src="{$BASE_URL*}/themes/default/images/cns_emoticons/shake.gif" title=":shake:" /><br />
<br />
2. You can join the Official BeatGrid team and help build apps for the system that way.&nbsp;<img alt=":lol:" src="{$BASE_URL*}/themes/default/images/cns_emoticons/lol.gif" title=":lol:" /><br />
