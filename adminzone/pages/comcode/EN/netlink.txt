[title]Partner sites[/title]

This page is used to configure the the list of partner links exported by this website, as used by {$BRAND_NAME*} [tt]side_network[/tt] block. This is a feature designed to make it easy for you to centrally manage one set of partner links, and display them on all partner sites.

The set of links will be used by any {$BRAND_NAME*} site that has been configured (via the "Network membership URL" option) to draw their links from:
[font="Courier"]{$BASE_URL*}/data/netlink.php[/font].

To add new links, simply place them on a new line, with an equals symbol between the link caption and the link URL. Some default links are provided for illustrative purposes only -- you may erase them.

If you are not using the [tt]side_network[/tt] block and nobody is linking to your [tt]http://yourbaseurl/data/netlink.php[/tt] file, then just ignore these settings.
